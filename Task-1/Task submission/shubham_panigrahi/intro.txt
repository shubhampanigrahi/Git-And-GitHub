Hi!

Regd No.- 2002030131
Domain- Coding
Hobbies- I like to read novels and sketch human faces

I applied and joined IIC because it is one of the best clubs in VSSUT Burla and moreover the seniors as well as my fellow first year students are really 
helpful and are always ready to help in every single task and any of my doubts. And I hope someday I'll be able to help my juniors too.

THANK YOU
